### This section makes logistic and lme models.

# Logistic regressions for the effect of treatment on the overall binary
# change in preferences.
# Treatment alone.
m1 <- glm(dif ~ treatment, df, family = binomial)
# Treatment plus separated 3- and 10-day treatments.
m2 <- glm(dif ~ treatment + time_treatment, df, family = binomial)
# m2 plus line fixed effect.
m3 <- glm(dif ~ treatment + time_treatment + line_y, df, family = binomial)
# m3 plus various demographic dimensions.
m4 <- glm(dif ~ treatment + time_treatment + line_y + obama_voter + romney_voter + male + ride_everyday + college, df, family = binomial)

# Logistic mixed-effect models.
# Treatment plus train car random effects.
m5 <- lmer(dif ~ treatment + (1 | treated_unit), df)
# m5 plus time fixed effects.
m6 <- lmer(dif ~ treatment + time_treatment + (1 | treated_unit), df)
