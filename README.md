# Replication: The Political Legacy of American Slavery

This is a partial replication of "The Political Legacy of American Slavery" by Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen, published in 2016 in the [*The Journal of Politics*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/slavery.pdf). The primary replication file is acharya_rep.pdf. See my comments in acharya_rep.Rmd for a more detailed explanation of the statistical methods the authors used.

Find all of the original replication data and code [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CAEEG7). Note that one primary dataset (abs-jop-cces-ind.csv) is too large to include on GitHub so must be downloaded separately from this link.
